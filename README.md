<h2>Exam Project 1st Semester, Autumn 2022</h2>

This project was a part of my University's assignment. I created a responsive experience site for hidden places in Aarhus, Denmark.

The website presents and conveys the full experience of the hidden places. The site functionates both as an information as well as an experience site, where the user can learn more about the places, see pictures and find directions to it.

I created content based on the needs of the target group when it comes to the chosen places. The site is considered as a marketing initiative about secret places in the city of Aarhus.
